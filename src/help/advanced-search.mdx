In Diarly, the search option shows results from all your journals, and by using special keywords and quotes `""` you can make your search more accurate.

## Special Keywords

![Advanced Search](./advanced-search.gif)

If you want to have an exact match, you can use **double-quotes**, like this: `"wonderful Monday"`.

If you use `#`, the keyword search will suggest all the tags used in all journals.

Diarly also supports following extra keywords starting with `@`

- `@files` — shows entries with at least one file (excluding images)
- `@images` — shows entries with at least one image
- `@todo` — shows entries with checklists
- `@starred` — shows starred entries
- `@links` — shows entries with links
- `@note` — shows notes, timeline entries are hidden
- `@tagged` - shows entries with at least one tag
- `@untagged` - shows entries without tags
- `@onThisDay` - shows timeline entries written on the same day, or notes created on the same day.


## Filtering by Journal

You can filter the search option to just one journal. If you start typing with `/` Diarly will display suggestions with all available journals to filter.

## Using Quotes for exact match

When a search includes multiple words, like `wonderful Monday`, the results will include entries that have both words (but not necessarily in the determined order). For example, the phrase `On Monday, a wonderful tabby cat visited me.`

To search for an exact phrase, you can add double quotes (`""`) around your search, like so: `"wonderful Monday"`. In this case, the phrase `This wonderful Monday morning` would be matched.
