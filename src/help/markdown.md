Diarly uses special characters to indicate text formatting. This is known as [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) — using special characters in your entry allows Diarly to store everything in plain text.

Some characters modify the entire line or paragraph, while others only a part of the text.

## **Line modifiers**

Line modifiers always start as the first characters of the new line followed by a space.  Diarly supports the following line modifiers:

- `# Headers` — there are four levels:
  - `# Main header`
  - `## Secondary header`
  - `### Tertiary header`
  - `#### Quaternary header`
- `* List item`
- `> Quotation`
- `[] Checklist item`
- `[x] Completed checklist item`

You can access the modifiers list by clicking on the checklist item to select/unselect the item.

Lists and checklists can be nested. You can use `⌘ [` and `⌘ ]` to increase and decrease the nesting level.

## **In-line text modifiers**

Those are `**Bold**`,  `*Italic*`,  `__Underline__`, `::highlighted::` `~striketrough~` and `` `code` `` (using the backtick key, right above the tab key). These modifiers can be used anywhere in the text, not just at the start of the line.

## **Links**

You can create links to websites using the following format:

`[Link to amazing website](http://amazing-website.com)`

Alternatively, you can select the text you want to convert into a link and paste the link, and it will be added automatically.
