import { Icon } from '../components/icons/icon.js';

## Mac

On Mac, you can drag and drop files directly into any day's entry.

Once your file is attached, it can be edited externally. After making changes to the file, **Diarly will detect the change** and update the new version to iCloud.

Please note that when making changes to the file on two devices at the same time, only the newest version will be used.

## iOS

On iOS, when writing or editing the text, an editor toolbar will be displayed where you can click on the <Icon icon="picture" size="20" /> icon. This will show you an option to attach a photo, video, or file.

You can also share files from other apps, using the share extension. You can learn more about sharing photos in the [Apple User Guides](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphf28f17237/ios).
