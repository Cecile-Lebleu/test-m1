The easiest way to get Application logs is to go:

Mac :  [Diarly > Help > Report Issue](diarly://reportIssue)
iPhone/iPad:  [iPhone/iPad Settings > Report Issue](diarly://reportIssue).

It should bring the email window with logs attached to the message.

But if you don't have the email setup on Mac, you can go to [Diarly > Help > Contact Us](diarly://contactUs). There is a link which should open directory on your Mac:

`~/Library/Containers/com.pureformstudio.diaryOSX/Data/Library/Logs/Diarly`
