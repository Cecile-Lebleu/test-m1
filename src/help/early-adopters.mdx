If you are one of the users who joined the Diarly family with the one-time purchase, as an Early Adopter, you don't need to purchase a subscription. All the current features are available for you.

However, ;) in future, there might be a necessity to purchase a subscription to have access to some of the new features (like Web/Android version).
