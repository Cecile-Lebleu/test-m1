On Mac, you can find available importers under `MenuBar > File > Import`.

On iOS, you can find import under `Settings > Import`

When importing, you will be shown additional information about which entries will be imported. If you are happy with the structure, just press the **import** button. Multiple entries for the same day will be merged into one, using time separators.

> Exporting to markdown allows you to create backups that you can easily import later. 

Currently, the app supports the following importers:

## Markdown

A zip archive containing `.md` files. You can check the structure of valid import files by viewing [how Diarly exports](/help/exporting-notes/) your entries.

## DayOne

- **DayOne JSON**: a zip archive.
- **DayOne classic**: a `.dayone` file, or a zip archive containing it. Find out more about [how to export your entries from DayOne](http://help.dayoneapp.com/day-one-classic/how-do-i-restore-from-a-backup-in-day-one-classic).

## Other apps and formats

- **MacJournal** (`.rtf` or `.txt`).
- **Journey** (`.zip`)
- **Momento**
- **WD**: Mike Terhar was so kind to write a [WD importer](https://gitlab.com/mterhar/wd-to-diarly-migration).
- **CSV**: Timothy Miller also created a [CSV importer](https://github.com/WebInspectInc/convert-csv-diarly).
