In Diarly, you can add or create a tag by adding `#` at the beginning of a word. For example, you can add `#memories` or `#family` into a day's entry.

Then, you can filter all entries by hashtags, to find related entries or special events.

Every time you add a new tag, Diarly will update the **filters** and **suggestions** so that you can filter by the newly created tags.
