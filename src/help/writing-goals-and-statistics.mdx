One of the reasons why keeping your journal is a worthwhile investment is that you can improve your writing skills. Best way to get good at something is to do it more. Diarly has simple tools built-in into it so that you can track how much you write, and while writing, show how much of the target you already reached.

**Writing Goals** and **statistics** are available only for the time-line/diary entries. As notes are something you keep and modify over time - they don't count in into the writing stats.
