On iPhone and iPad you can simply delete the app to remove all the files. On Mac you need to remove also the following directory to delete files for notes:

`~/Library/Containers/com.pureformstudio.diaryOSX`

If you can not find these files, please go to Diarly > Help > Contact, there is a link to remove all data from computer and iCloud.
