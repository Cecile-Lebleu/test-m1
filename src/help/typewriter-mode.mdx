Diarly has a Typewriter mode, which by default is enabled. To disable this option, you can go to `MenuBar > View > Typewriter Mode`. 

When Typewriter mode is enabled, it will keep the insertion point in the middle of the note window.  This is useful when writing a longer text when usually the insertion point would be at the bottom of the window.
