If you have multiple files sync can take few minutes so please be patient.  If you are experiencing issues with sync:

- Firstly make sure you are logged with **same iCloud account** on all devices you want to sync too.

- Make sure you have **iCloud Drive enabled** and Diarly has access to it on all devices:

Please follow these instructions: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204025](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204025) to make sure you have your iCloud Drive set up correctly.

## Starting the sync

- On Mac Please edit any text note (this triggers sync).
- On iOS you can also scroll list view in opposite direction (so called pull to refresh).  This will start sync and update you when the sync is finished.

## Checking the Status

You can check current status of syncing in `Settings > Sync & Encryption Tab` and on iPhone using pull to refresh.

## Checking the Logs

Is sync will be unsuccessful. You can investigate the logs.

The easiest way to get application logs is to go

Mac : [Diarly > Help > Report Issue](diarly://contactUs)
iPhone/iPad:  [iPhone/iPad Settings > Report Issue](diarly://contactUs)

If sync does not work for a few hours - please send us application logs - we will try to help as soon as possible.
