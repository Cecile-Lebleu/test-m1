The option of recovering the forgotten password for your entries is unavailable, therefore, in such situation, you might try the following:

- Try entering the password at least 3 times, as then so Diarly will display tip which you set when setting the password.
- Try using any other passwords that you may have
- Try recalling if you used numbers, letters, names
- Check if you might have written down the password  

### If you don't remember the password

You can only recover attachments by opening following directory:

`~/Library/Containers/com.pureformstudio.diaryOSX/Data/Library/Application\ Support/com.pureformstudio.diaryOSX/data`

To be able to use the app again, please go to `Diarly > Help > Contact" - there is a link to remove all Data from Local Machine and iCloud.
