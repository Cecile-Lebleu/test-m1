> iCloud Sync is only available to Diarly Premium users.

Diarly uses iCloud's [Private User Database](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckcontainer/1399205-privateclouddatabase). This database allows only you, the user, to access the data inside. We, as the **developers have no access** to the any data stored.

To be able to sync data across devices using iCloud, you need to:

- be logged with the same Apple ID on all devices
- have iCloud Drive enabled
- allow Diarly to access iCloud Drive

After you have done all the steps, you can try editing the entry and the text will automatically update on the other device. You donâ€™t need to do anything, as the application automatically detects and syncs the change. The other device will refresh content instantly.

If you are experiencing issues with sync, please check our article on [syncing issues](/help/syncing-issues). If your problem still isn't resolved, please reach out and we will be happy to help.
