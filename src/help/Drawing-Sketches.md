import { Icon } from '../components/icons/icon.js';


On iOS apps, you can insert your drawings using the sketch option. To add the drawing, start editing the text and then choose the <Icon icon="brush" size="20" /> icon above the keyboard. You can later reopen and modify the sketch again.

Once you add your sketch, it will be also available on Mac app, however, you will not be able to edit the sketch.
