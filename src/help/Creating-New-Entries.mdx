import { Icon } from '../components/icons/icon.js';

When you open Diarly on Mac and on iPad, a new entry will be created for you automatically. This allows you to simply open the app and start typing.

If you want to add an entry to a different day, you can use the calendar <Icon icon="calendar" size="20" /> . When you select an empty day, a new entry is created.

You can use the edit button <Icon icon="edit" size="20" /> in the list view to create a new entry for today, or use the shortcut `⌘N`. This will create new entry with the [daily prompt](/help/daily-prompt/) — or, if an entry for the day already exists, it will insert a time separator.

You can also use `⌘⇧N` to insert your [daily prompt](/help/daily-prompt/) in any opened entry.
