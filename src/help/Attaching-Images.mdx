import { Icon } from '../components/icons/icon.js';

## Mac

There are numerous ways with which you can insert image into your entry on Mac:

- Drag the image file into editor
- Go to `MenuBar > Format > Insert > File` and choose the file
- Right- click and choose `Take Photo` to insert the image directly from nearby iPhone/iPad

## iOS

To add an image, start editing note so the keyboard toolbar is displayed. You can click on picture icon <Icon icon="picture" size="20" /> .

This will show you an option to attach an image from `Camera`, `Image Library` or `Files`.

You can also share files from other applications, using share extension. You can read more about sharing photos in [Apple User Guides](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphf28f17237/ios).

Once you add an image, you can double click to open it.
