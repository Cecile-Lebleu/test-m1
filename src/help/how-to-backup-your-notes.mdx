## Backup using iCloud

If you have the full version of Diarly and iCloud sync enabled, all your data is backed up automatically on iCloud, so your data is safe in case of computer failure or other difficulties.

## Backup manually

To prevent any accidental removal or to have your data safely stored on an additional location, you can use the Diarly [Markdown exporter](/help/exporting-notes/).

You can use the exporter by going to:

* **Mac**: `Menu Bar > File > Export > Diarly (markdown)`
* **iOS**: `Settings >  Export > Diarly (markdown)`

This will export a zip file containing `.md` files and images. The zip file can later be imported back to Diarly, or the markdown files can be opened in any text editor.

> When you later import markdown entries into the app, it will skip/ignore those which already exist so that your data is not overwritten.
