Diarly is a digital diary and journaling app for Mac & iOS. Inspired by [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius), Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher, and avid journal keeper. Diarly was born with the idea to be a modern tool that Aurelius would choose.

Our main goals are:

- **Private** — nobody should have access to your notes.
- **Simple** — easy to use and distraction-free, allowing you to focus on writing.
- Highly **customizable** — everyone is different, so we give you options to make it **your** journal that will be unique.
- Available to **everyone** — most of the functionalities in the app are available for free, as our goal is to help more people get into journaling. In the future, we hope to make Diarly available for more platforms, not just for Mac and iOS.
